# Simple mobile apps by Stephen Tigner privacy policy

My simple mobile apps (e.g. *Better Buy*) do not gather or retain any personal data.
They are very simple apps that just do simple tasks on the device.
They make no network calls, no phoning home, and I have not included any analytics libraries in them.

Google Play insists I must have a privacy policy hosted somewhere to publish my simple do-not-take-any-of-your-information moble apps, so here it is.

If this is still confusing for some reason, inquiries may be directed by email to `app-privacy` at my domain `stephentigner.com`.
(Email is obfuscated that way to cut down on simple scraping by spammers.)

I reserve the right to update this privacy policy from time-to-time, as necessary, without notice to users.
The main reason for not notifying users is because I do not collect any of their information, thus I have no means to contact them.
